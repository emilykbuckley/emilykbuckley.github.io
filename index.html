            <h1>Mitral Valve Disease in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels</h1>
            <h2 class="text-center">A computational approach to deeper understanding</h2>
            <h3>What is Mitral Valve Disease (MVD)?</h3>
            <img src="heart.png" alt="Heart Diagram" class="center">
            <p class="body-text">
                In normal function, deoxygenated blood flows from the body through the right atrium and right ventricle and into the lungs. This newly oxygenated blood flows from the lungs back into the heart in the left atrium, through the mitral valve, into the left ventricle, and back out into the body. <br>
                The mitral valve is the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle. Over time, this valve can degenerate, thicken, and prolapse, leading to Mitral Regurgitation, where blood flows back into the left atrium. Mitral Valve Disease first presents itself as a heart murmur, but as the disease progresses, it can lead to heart failure and congestive heart failure. The heart can enlarge, fluid may fill up the lungs, and the heart cannot pump enough blood throughout the body. A dog with heart failure may experience quickened breathing, shortness of breath, or fainting. <br>
                MVD in dogs is very similar to Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) in humans, so MVD serves as a good model for MVP. By understanding the causes, development, and progression of MVD in dogs better, we can hopefully gain a better understanding of Mitral Valve Prolapse as well.

            <h3>MVD in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS)</h3>
            <img src="Sweetie.JPG" alt="Cavalier King Charles Spaniel" class="center">
            <p class="body-text">
                MVD is the leading cause of death in CKCS. This disease is 20 times more prevalent in Cavaliers than in other dog breeds. At age 5, over 50% of Cavaliers will be diagnosed with MVD. At ages 10 and up, over 90& of Cavaliers will be diagnosed with MVD. <br>
                MVD also progresses much quicker in Cavaliers than in other dog breeds. After a Mitral Valve Disease diagnosis, other dog breeds have a life expectancy of 3-5 years. In Cavaliers, on the other hand, MVD is life threatening within 1-3 years after a diagnosis. <br>
                MVD is a highly-heritable disease, but selective breeding methods are not very effective. Breeders are encouraged to wait until a Cavalier has reached 5 years of age without an MVD murmur befofre breeding, which helps avoid breeding Cavaliers with early-onset MVD. However, many Cavaliers develop MVD later in life, so this method does not perfectly prevent passing this disease down. <br>
                MVD is a polygenic disease, meaning the disease is influenced by multiple genes. This can make it more difficult to selectively breed against this trait, as they do not follow Mendelian inheritance patterns. Many factors can play into the development and progression of MVD, making it more difficult to prevent and treat. As we begin to understand the genetic causes of MVD, we may be able to create more gene therapies or treatments such as CRISPR to target this disease. <br>
                Smaller dog breeds tend to live longer lives than larger breeds, but Cavaliers face a shortened life expectancy, primarily due to MVD. Cavaliers have a life expectancy of about 9-14 years. MVD is much more prevalent in Cavaliers, affects them at a younger age, progresses quicker, and has a higher mortality rate. If we could understand and treat MVD more efficiently, Cavaliers could live longer, healthier, happier lives. <br>
